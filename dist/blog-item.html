					<h2>Corporate metaverses</h2>
					<p>
						Imagine meeting in the metaverse – teams developing the next big
						thing, holding product launch events, closing sales, supporting
						customers, and managing human resource needs. The next evolution in
						engaging experiences, the metaverse’s impact on business is broad
						and deep. It’s changing the way we do everything.
					</p>

					<p>
						“The ways in which we work and play have changed forever, and the
						metaverse will significantly disrupt how people and brands interact
						and engage. Almost every CMO and HR leader we talk to is looking for
						ways to harness the power of the metaverse, and to drive new
						engagement paradigms with their customers, employees and partners.
						New use cases and opportunities are rapidly forming, and the
						possibilities are endless,” Yaron Lipshitz, Allseated CEO, said.
					</p>

					<p>
						From operations, HR and innovation, to marketing, sales and customer
						support, the metaverse will drive every aspect of your business.
						Business in the metaverse means moving beyond the limitations of
						basic 2D video communication. A corporate metaverse means teams,
						partners and customers can connect, communicate and collaborate
						through intentionally designed experiences in fully customized, 3D
						digital workplaces.
					</p>

					<p>This guide:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Contrasts 2D and 3D meeting delivery</li>
						<li>
							Describes what meetings in the metaverse look like and how they
							run
						</li>
						<li>Highlights features for SMBs/SMEs and large enterprises</li>
						<li>Discusses who’s using the metaverse</li>
					</ul>

					<h4>
						Virtual reality business meetings: delivering meetings in 2D vs. 3D
					</h4>

					<h4>2D</h4>

					<p>
						Two components missing in a world where remote work is the new
						normal are a sense of presence and the idea of belonging. Generally,
						it’s the intangibles that technology hasn’t serviced, and the
						tangibles have been, really, just slightly evolved.
					</p>

					<p>
						Phones have existed for around 100 years. Then came 2D video
						combining basic communication and the ability to read each other’s
						social and visual cues. 2D video platforms such as Zoom and Skype,
						along with project management tools like Microsoft Teams, work OK
						for quick, basic communication, but they don’t support intentionally
						designed experiences. As a result, complaints about “Zoom Fatigue”
						abound because it’s a flat experience with no way for people to
						connect and interact naturally. There’s no way to spontaneously have
						a conversation or move from place-to-place as when meeting together
						in a physical space.
					</p>

					<h4>3D</h4>

					<p>
						Historically, in a sales environment, people have gone to a lot of
						trouble to physically be in front of someone with whom they want to
						do business. When you have a sense of presence with someone, you
						accelerate trust.
					</p>

					<p>
						3D is about adding another dimension to how people come together and
						communicate virtually. A cornerstone of the metaverse, 3D provides a
						sense of belonging. Virtual reality technology has given
						organizations the ability to scale that sense of presence, of
						belonging, because teams are in a shared environment where they can
						connect and collaborate as if they were physically meeting.
					</p>

					<p>
						While digital workplaces aren’t completely replacing physically
						meeting together, the world has changed to a remote world, and
						there’s no going back. That said, remote interaction could be
						better. In 2D business meetings, team members can talk to each
						other, but there’s no meaningful experiences to help them connect.
						Doing business in the metaverse means now you have meetings in 3D
						digital workplaces specifically created for intentionally designed
						experiences. The 3D environment of the metaverse offers
						opportunities for unplanned conversations, where things happen
						organically. Teams and individuals experience real connection, a
						feeling of belonging and community as they engage and move around
						naturally in a virtual world that mirrors the physical world.
					</p>

					<h4>What do meetings in the metaverse look like?</h4>

					<p>
						Meetings held in the metaverse look like meetings you physically
						attend in-person. The big difference is the delivery method. You’re
						moving from being on-site in a traditional setting or communicating
						over 2D video (both with complex limitations) to delivery in a
						digital workplace, which offers more creative flexibility, allows
						freedom to move, fosters spontaneous conversation, and builds trust.
					</p>

					<h4>The advantages of the metaverse</h4>

					<p>In the metaverse:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Connect with people in unique ways</li>
						<li>
							Engage naturally with people 1-on-1 or bring people together in
							groups
						</li>
						<li>Share information and media in real time.</li>
						<li>
							Move quickly from one space to another with self-guided navigation
						</li>
						<li>
							Access the metaverse from anywhere through a reliable Internet
							connection
						</li>
					</ul>

					<h4>Benefits of the metaverse for teams</h4>

					<p>
						As they would in physical spaces, internal teams can create
						together, and external teams can connect with leads and customers in
						the metaverse. Create unique, team-specific spaces that help:
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Facilitate organic, natural interaction</li>
						<li>Drive creativity</li>
						<li>
							Focus on achieving team/business unit goals in support of larger
							organizational goals
						</li>
					</ul>

					<h4>Creative freedom in the metaverse</h4>

					<p>
						An organization isn’t static, neither is its metaverse. As an
						organization’s needs change, so does its metaverse. 3D virtual
						reality meeting rooms are a great place to start. Imagine in one
						room, an HR team is holding a training session. In the next room,
						the marketing team is hosting a product launch event. In another
						room, the sales team is closing a sale. It’s easy to expand from a
						few meeting rooms to a comprehensive digital office environment
						including a boardroom, corporate events spaces, team rooms, and
						office spaces for individual team members. Enjoy creative freedom.
						Duplicate a physical corporate office space or create something
						totally new.
					</p>

					<h4>How do you run meetings in the metaverse?</h4>

					<p>
						Running meetings in the metaverse is different than running a
						meeting in a 2D space. In a linear 2D environment, people must
						consume content in one space and then consume content in the next
						space. There’s no freedom of movement, no choice, no real way to
						connect with each other.
					</p>

					<p>
						Alternatively, the 3D environment of the metaverse gives options.
						Meetings are much more fluid and offer freedom of movement. Team
						members can go into different spaces and contribute to different
						conversations. Start in one place, then move to the next space that
						serves them best or where they can contribute the most. The
						metaverse allows them to move around at will and connect anywhere.
					</p>

					<p>
						Content works the same way. Teams can share information and media in
						real time, providing content anywhere in the metaverse. Outside of
						meeting spaces, for example, it’s easy to offer content to watch or
						read in preparation for a meeting.
					</p>

					<p>
						In a 2D virtual space, team members having a series of meetings must
						attend each meeting in its entirety. On the other hand, holding
						meetings in a corporate metaverse gives the flexibility to float
						between concurrent meetings, listen to what people are saying,
						contribute as necessary, and move to the next meeting. That way team
						members can cross-pollinate many different conversations with new
						ideas, enabling them to use their time wisely.
					</p>

					<h2>Metaverse features for SMBs and SMEs vs Enterprise</h2>

					<h4>Why should SMBs set up a virtual office?</h4>

					<p>
						Small and Medium-Sized Businesses/Enterprises (SMBs/SMEs) have fewer
						assets. They must do more with less. They compete with large
						enterprises. SMBs’ competitive advantage over large enterprise lies
						in their speed. They’re much faster. To maintain competitive
						advantage, SMBs need to connect more effectively within in their
						organizations.
					</p>

					<p>
						While SMBs, generally, don’t struggle with silos, as they work more
						through 2D virtual environments, siloing will become a problem.
						Setting up a corporate metaverse (such as a comprehensive digital
						office environment) will help SMBs maintain their strengths and
						prevent the silo pitfalls larger organizations experience.
					</p>

					<h4>
						Why should large enterprise organizations set up a virtual office?
					</h4>

					<p>
						For large enterprise organizations, with so many tools and resources
						at their disposal, it’s easy for them to become siloed. 2D
						platforms, which are popular now, do nothing to solve the problem of
						silos. In fact, 2D platforms reinforce silos as they come together
						through a lack of connectivity between departments.
					</p>

					<p>
						In 2D scenarios, there’s no ability to be in a meeting with the
						marketing team and look down the hall and see the sales team or walk
						past the sales team office and hear a conversation. There’s no
						possibility of an open door for a team member, manager, director or
						a CEO. You can’t do any of those things spontaneously in a 2D
						environment. On the other hand, 3D environments (such as
						metaverse-based digital office setups) do a great job of breaking
						down silos, enabling and encouraging spontaneous conversation.
						Departments will connect and share more effectively, reducing
						duplication of work and ensuring alignment with overarching business
						requirements.
